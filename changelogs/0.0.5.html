        <h2>Changelog: v0.0.5 (beta) - December 23, 2024</h2>
        <p>
            OK so 0.0.3 should've been 0.0.4. Thus there is no <em>real</em> 0.0.4 but like, eh.<br>
            Welcome to v0.0.5!
            -Added functioning for AI-less, attack-less entities! With animations and everything. Veeeeerry swanky<br>
            -Added animations which render based on the tile grid<br>
            -Added a method for consumable items. Might change that GUI bit up somewhat
            -Added a 'test goblin' that you can repeatedly thwack with a sword but not anything else because I have yet to add in attack functionality to everything <br>
            -Removed arrow keys / WASD movement unless you're in debug move<br>
            -Changed up some of the way entities and animations are structured under the hood because Javascript is a bit of a poopy-head when it comes to handling the copying of objects. Be warned!<br>
            -You can't move through entities btw<br>
