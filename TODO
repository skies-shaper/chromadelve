-if it's a mobile device, tell them the game won't work, but maybe like give some screenshots and encourage them to get it from ein computer

-Make a room editor
-Make a tileset for each element


TO DO:
Add enemies
Add basic enemy AI
Essentially, a lil fighty dungeon crawler (infinite I suppose) - randomized end goals, just rack up a score. THEN, (since combat sytem will be worked out), do the chroma bit :)

Fire: 
Red, volcanic rocks.

Poison:
Darker stone bricks, dripping with oozes

Water:
A lighter-grey stone brick, with some ice and stuff

Air: 
brighter colors - more white / yellow versions of the bricks in 

Life: 
very mossy stones

Lightning: 
spaceshippppp


Gameplay turn loop: 

-Move
-Attack    

-Enemies attack
-Enemies move




Multiplayer (LAN):
One person runs a node app which hosts the game on a given port.
This provides a lil console setup for them (to restart a game, etc)
Everyone else goes to the provided link (if using a web browser)
The node app will serve the multiplayer HTML file.
The multiplayer file will mostly act to render the player's screen. The player whose turn it is will be served a list of options for what they can do (move, make various attacks). The option they choose will be transmitted to the multiplayer server, which will validate it and then send a new game state to everyone.

Add settings:
\_ manage saves
    \_ rename (?) games

Game saves:
\_ give most recent version saved in and other metadata, just in case

MAKE MORE TILES AND ENTITY ART !!!! !!! !! !!!!

\_ 'spawn eggs' - tiles where monsters are guaranteed to spawn
